<h1>Credit Risk Analysis Tool</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This project aims to build, evaluate, and interpret machine learning models to predict credit risk using the German Credit dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and model interpretation. The models used are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The German Credit dataset is used for this project. It contains 1000 instances and 20 attributes plus the target variable indicating the credit risk

<h2>Features</h2>
1. Data Preprocessing: Loads and preprocesses the data, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.<br>
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes the data distribution and correlation matrix to understand the relationships between variables.</br>
3. Feature Engineering: Selects the most relevant features for model building.</br>
4. Model Building and evaluation: Trains Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models. Evaluates the models using accuracy, classification report, and AUC score.</br>
5. Model Interpretation and Visualization: Analyzes feature importances to understand which features contribute most to the predictions.

<h2>Importance and Use Cases</h2>
1. Risk Management: Helps financial institutions assess the risk associated with loan applicants.</br>
2. Predictive Analytics: Demonstrates the use of machine learning for predictive analytics in finance.</br>
3. Data Science Practice: Provides a comprehensive project for practicing data science and machine learning skills.</br>
4. Model Interpretability: Emphasizes the importance of understanding model predictions.

<h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
1. Programming Language: Python.</br>
2. Libraries:</br>
i. Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy</br>
ii. Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn</br>
iii. Machine Learning: Scikit-learn</br>
3. Development Environment: Visual Studio Code</br>
